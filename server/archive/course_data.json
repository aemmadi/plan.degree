How can different diseases affect identical twins sharing the same genetic information? Why our parents and grandparents diet and health may have lasting influences in our own health? The field of epigenetics emerged over the past decades to tackle these fundamental questions that intersect our genome, development, environment and disease. This course will provide a broad overview of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic mechanisms with weekly lectures and small group discussion of primary literature. The course will introduce students to seminal works in epigenetics and recent developments with the goal of instilling critical knowledge of the field.  ",

Recent methods on amino acid evolution and its connections to molecular structure and function are also studied. Relevant examples of molecular evolution presented in this course include protein interactions, signaling networks, and viral evolution. Students learn computational tools and algorithms used to study evolution at the molecular level and work on a proposal-like research project applying tools and concepts learned in class to investigate new research questions in their area of specialization.

Teams must carry the engineering project to completion, examining real world and multiple design constraints, following applicable industrial and business standards. Such constraints may include but are not limited to: economic, environmental, industrial standards, team time/resource management and cross-disciplinary/departmental result integration. Students are required to work in teams that include collaborative design interaction. Additionally, cross-disciplinary/departmental teams are encouraged but not required. In Senior Design I, project proposals will be written, reviewed and approved. Initial designs will be completed and corresponding constraints will be determined. All students will participate in a public oral and poster presentation following departmental approved guidelines at a departmental approved time and location. Teams will also submit a written end of semester progress report and documented team communication ",

Teams must carry the engineering project to completion, examining real world and multiple design constraints, following applicable industrial and business standards. Such constraints may include but are not limited to: economic, environmental, industrial standards, team time/resource management and cross-disciplinary/departmental result integration. Students are required to work in teams that include collaborative design interaction. Additionally, cross-disciplinary teams are encouraged but not required. In Senior Design I, project proposals will be written, reviewed and approved. Initial designs will be completed and corresponding constraints will be determined. All students will participate in a public oral and poster presentation following departmental approved guidelines at a departmental approved time and location. Teams will also submit a written end of semester progress report and documented team communication ",

The goal of senior design projects is to prepare the student to run/participate in engineering projects related to an appropriate industry. Thus, all project teams are to follow standard industrial practices and methods. Teams must carry the engineering project to completion, examining real world and multiple design constraints, following applicable industrial and business standards. Such constraints may include but are not limited to: economic, environmental, industrial standards, team time/resource management and cross-disciplinary/departmental result integration. Students are required to work in teams that include collaborative design interaction. Additionally, cross-disciplinary teams are encouraged but not required. In Senior Design I, project proposals will be written, reviewed and approved. Initial designs will be completed and corresponding constraints will be determined. All students will participate in a public oral and poster presentation following departmental approved guidelines at a departmental approved time and location. Teams will also submit a written end of semester progress report and documented team communication ",

Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations. Using case studies, this course offers students opportunities to sharpen their analytical skills with real world applications and expand upon black-and-white theories from business and economics. ",

Why are natural resources a blessing in Botswana but a curse in Nigeria? If we have learned anything from developing countries' experiences, it is that there is no universal \"one-size-fits-it-all\" answer. This course explores the conditions under which grand theories of development are valid.

The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as \"What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events?\", \"How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks?\", \"Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam?\", and \"Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not?\" This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government. Future investors and government officials will need the skills necessary to analyze the two-way relationship of politics affecting finance and finance shaping politics. ",

This form of experiential education enables students to grow through three distinct goals; academic learning, personal growth, and civic engagement. Each course section will have a different emphasis but will share a focus on the inter- and intra-personal development of 21st century skills, and reflective and reciprocal experiences. Community-engaged learning has been described as a transformative experience and identified as a high-impact practice in education.
