Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy.

The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as \"What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events?\", \"How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks?\", \"Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam?\", and \"Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not?\" This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government.
